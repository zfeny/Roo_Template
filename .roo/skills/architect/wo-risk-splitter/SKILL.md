# WO Risk Splitter

Decompose large goals into auditable WO streams.

## Workflow
1. Extract requirements and NFR risks from `_SPECs/`.
2. Split into WO streams by risk boundary and dependency.
3. Define interface contracts and integration risks per WO.
4. Produce sequencing plan and acceptance mapping.
