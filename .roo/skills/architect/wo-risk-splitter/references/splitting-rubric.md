# Splitting Rubric

## Split By
1. External interface change.
2. Data model migration.
3. High-risk NFR (latency, reliability, security).
4. Release dependency boundary.

## Output Contract
1. One WO has one measurable acceptance objective.
2. WO dependencies are acyclic and explicit.
3. Rollback surface is bounded per WO.
