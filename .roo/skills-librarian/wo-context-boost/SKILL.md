# WO Context Boost

Use this skill only when lean context is insufficient.

## Steps
1. Expand file map and contracts:
   - `bash .roo_template/09_automations/01_scripts/00_wo.sh prepare-context-all {WO}`
2. Update:
   - `02_FileMap.md`
   - `03_API_Contracts.md`
   - `04_Decisions_Summary.md`
3. Ensure updates directly support active implementation/review concerns.

## Output Checklist
- Context pack is reviewable and traceable
- Added docs map to current WO scope
